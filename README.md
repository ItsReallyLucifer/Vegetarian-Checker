# Vegetarian Food Checker

## Description

The **Vegetarian Food Checker** is a handy application designed to help users determine whether a food product is vegetarian-friendly or not. Users can enter a UPC barcode number (12 digits), and the application provides a list of ingredients, highlighting each ingredient's vegetarian status as "Yes," "No," or "Maybe."
